# Sample AEM and React project template

This is a fork of the standard [aem project template](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-project-archetype). It adds support for [aem-react](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/aem-react).

It provides the additional react specific features:

1. Development environment 

 In the folder `/ui.app/src/main/ts` there is a complete node based development environment for creating react components.

2. Content

 There are example react components in the en.html example page at the top.

3. Example react components

 There are two react components: text and panel which are available in the same sidekick componen group as all the other example components.
